=== New in This Release

This release contains many improvements, including:

* Improved structure usability with DataWeave and MEL by including "Loop" in the key name for loops and using underscores instead of spaces. You will need to update your integrations appropriately for this (see below).
* Improved validation logic on writing.
* Many bug fixes

For more information, such as how to install or use these modules, see
xref:partner-manager::index.adoc[Anypoint B2B], xref:partner-manager::edifact-module.adoc[EDIFACT Module], and xref:partner-manager::x12-module.adoc[X12 Module].

=== Migration Guide

All of your transformations and expressions that references parts of the EDI message structure must be updated for the following changes:

* The "Transactions" list has been changed to "TransactionSets" and now has an additional level for the version of the transactions.
** Example: payload.Transactions."850" now becomes payload.TransactionSets.v5010."850"
* All keys no longer have spaces - instead they have underscores
** Example: payload."0100 PO1" becomes payload."0100_PO1"
* Any segment that is a loop
** Example: payload.Detail."0100 PO1" becomes payload.Detail."0100_PO1_Loop"

== Known Issues

The following issues apply to all versions:

* X12 binary segments are not supported, are not included in schema definitions, and cause errors.
* Code values are not currently verified for either reading or writing. (as of version 1.3.0, X12 HIPAA validation supports mandated code values)
