*April 16, 2019*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software | Version
|Mule Runtime | 4.0.0 and later
|===

=== Features

* Redelivery policy options (max. redeliveries and outcome) were added to the connector's configuration.

=== Fixed in this Release

* When dealing with manual ACK, if the flow failed with an error, the message could be reprocessed indefinitely. This is now fixed by the addition of the *redelivery policy* configuration.

=== Known Issues

* Automatic completion of queue/topic names, subscriptions and rules may not work in Design Center.
* Under some scenarios, users can get an `InterruptedException` error on the Mule app startup. This will not affect the proper operation. To get rid of this message, check the "Skip Connectivity Test" checkbox in the connector's configuration.

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software | Version
|Mule Runtime | 4.0.0 and later
|===

=== Fixed in this Release

=== Known Issues

* Automatic completion of queue or topic names, subscriptions, and rules may not work in Design Center.
* In Design Center, the Live View feature does not work for most operations. In addition to this, the application log may be flooded with several "Could not serialize object" errors.

|===
|Software | Version
|Mule Runtime | 4.0.0 and later

=== Fixed in this Release

* Manual ACK not working - Previously, when attempting to do a manual acknowledge of a message, the connector would lock the flow. This was now fixed, and doing this works as expected.

=== Known Issues

* Automatic completion of queue and topic names, subscriptions and rules may not work in Design Center.
* In Design Center, the Live View feature will not work for most operations. In addition to this, the application log may be flooded with several "Could not serialize object" errors.
