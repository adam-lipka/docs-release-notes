=== Fixed in this Release

This is the first version of the connector, thus no fixes were required; there are only new features.

=== Known Issues

==== Providing a Subclass as Type To a Complex Field

Some objects have complex fields that represent a base class from Salesforce Marketing. So, if instead of the base class, you want to pass a subclass of it as value to that field, that is not possible
because the connector is not recognize the fields that do not belong to the base class. You must manually map those fields in Transform Message and add a field named "concreteClassType" with the name of the subclass as value. For more information and an example, read the connector guide.

==== Retrieving Fields From a Hierarchy Not Possible

Querying fields that are lower than level 1 in the hierarchy is not supported by the API. For example,queries like `Select Attributes.Name from Subscriber` because Name is at level 2 in the hierarchy.

==== Server Results that Contain an Automation Object Structure Cause Exception to Be Thrown

When performing operations on an Automation object, the result of the operation  causes an exception to be thrown because the response has a field that cannot be parsed by the API. To bypass this, make those types of operations asynchronous.
