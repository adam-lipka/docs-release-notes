=== Features

* Added Delete Data Set operation to delete datasets that are not needed anymore.
* Changed the DataSense mechanism of the connector to provide dynamic metadata for Upload External Data, Start Data Processing and Delete Data Set operations. Now you can select the dataset ID for which one of the mentioned operations executes. For the Upload External Data operation, we also provide dynamic input metadata that describes the format of the data to be uploaded to the selected dataset.
* Create Data Set and Upload External Data Into New Data Set And Start Processing operations now allow the user to select a file that serves as a schema description of the dataset to be created. These operations do not have DataSense support anymore, as the file describing the dataset schema can't be read at design time.
