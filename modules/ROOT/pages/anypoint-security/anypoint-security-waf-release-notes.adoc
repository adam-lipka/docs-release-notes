== May 4, 2019

A summary log (`rtfSidSummary`) is generated, which contains a list of rule instances (rule ID, API, method, direction, and count) where at least one SID rule was triggered during the one-minute collection interval. See xref:anypoint-security::sid-reference.adoc[Sensitive Information Detection] for more information. 

This release contains the following known issue:

Sensitive information detection is not bi-directional. When you configure the WAF policy and enable the *Detect sensitive information* option for *Request Rulesets* and also enable the *Detect sensitive information* option for *Response Rulesets*, the response does not get scanned for sensitive information detection. 

Workaround: If you need to enable SID for responses, de-select the *Detect sensitive information* option for requests. 

== April 20, 2019

== New Features

When you configure a WAF policy, there is a new option to enable sensitive information detection (SID) for the request and response bodies. For more information, see xref:anypoint-security::create-waf-policy.adoc[Create a Web Application Firewall Security Policy].

== April 6, 2019

== New Features

In a Runtime Fabric configured with a DoS policy, you can manage blocked IP addresses. For more information, see xref:anypoint-security::manage-blocked-ip-in-rtf.adoc[Manage Blocked IP Addresses in Runtime Fabric]. 

== Fixed Issues

=== Application Deployment Fails

* The issue where Edge did not honor the *Read Request Time-out* configuration setting of the Runtime Fabric inbound traffic configuration is fixed.
* The issue where Edge failed to route requests to the application when the client (through the request header) asserts `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is fixed.

== December 10, 2018

== New Feature: Web Application Firewall Policy

You can now configure web application firewall policies for Runtime Fabric inbound traffic to provide protection at the Web application level. For more information, see xref:anypoint-security::waf-policy.adoc[Web Application Firewall Security Policy].

== Known Limitations, Issues, and Workarounds

=== Max Response Msg Body is Capped

(MSG-6502) The maximum response message body is 512 KB. The limit is needed to make sure that excessive resources are not consumed when scanning response bodies. By default, the *Disable body scanner* option is left unchecked, which means the response message body will be scanned for rules violations.

If response message body scanning is not disabled, traffic with response bodies larger than 512 KB are rejected.

*Workaround*

Disable response message body scanning by checking the *Disable body scanner* option when you create a WAF policy.

=== WAF Summary Includes Unsupported Rules

(MSG-6486) The WAF summary message includes 53 rules that are not supported at this time.

The WAF summary message, which appears in the RTF Input Traffic logs, lists Rule IDs for OWASP CRS that are not supported by Anypoint Security for various reasons. The correct list of rule IDs is shown in the Edge API Policies RAML file `dataTypes/policies/WafRules/Rulesets.json`.

At startup, an error is thrown for each unsupported rules, however, these are not really errors. 

The following Rule IDs listed in the WAF summary message are not supported:

[source, text, linenums]
----
913101, 913102, 920200, 920201, 920230, 920300, 920271, 920320, 920121,
920272, 920202, 920273, 920274, 920460, 921151, 921180, 931130, 933151,
933131, 933161, 933111, 941101, 941150, 941320, 941330, 941340, 942110,
942120, 942130, 942150, 942180, 942200, 942210, 942260, 942300, 942310,
942330, 942340, 942370, 942380, 942390, 942400, 942410, 942430, 942440,
942450, 942251, 942420, 942431, 942460, 942421, 942432, 950100
----

*Workaround*

Disregard these rule IDs in the WAF summary message report. They are always reported with zero counts. These rule IDs are not executed so there is no reason to disable them when disabling rule IDs for false positives.

=== MIME Type Support for Response Body Checking are Limited

(MSG-6430) In the current release, a limited non-configurable list of mime types are supported for response body checking.

The supported MIME types are:

* text/plain
* text/html
* text/xml
* application/json

If the content type of the response message does not match a supported MIME type, it is not scanned.

*Workaround*

If response bodies do not have a supported MIME type for response body checking, you must write additional application business logic to make appropriate checks before sending responses.

== Fixed Issues

=== Excessive Logging Slows Performance

(MSG-5637) The issue where excessive logging was slowing performance for bad `x-forwarded-for header` has been fixed.

The Edge was logging a message for each invalid IP address encountered in a source IP header such as `x-forwarded-for`. This header is client changeable. If an attacker provided an invalid value, this log message generated at the rate of one log message for each message, which degraded Edge performance at a rate equal to how fast it could log messages.

*Fix*

The message was changed from ERROR level to DEBUG level so performance is not degraded for Edges that are using the recommended or default production log level setting of ERROR.
