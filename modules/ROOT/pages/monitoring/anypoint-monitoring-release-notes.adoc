* *Anypoint Custom Metrics Connector* - (Requires a Titanium subscription) The Anypoint Custom Metrics connector enables sending metric values with dimensions to Anypoint Monitoring, where they can be visualized in real time using Custom Dashboards. See xref:connectors::metrics/custom-metrics-connector.adoc[Custom Metrics Connector].

== December 8, 2018
This release contains the following new features:

* *Log Points* - (Requires Titanium subscription) You can generate logs for a running API without writing any code or redeploying your application. You can select specific parameters within the API for which to generate logs, for example, the request header `host` parameter. For more information about log points, see xref:monitoring::log-points.adoc[Anypoint Monitoring Log Points]
* *Connector-level Flow Analysis* - (Requires Titanium subscription) You can now monitor the performance for connectors. For more information about monitoring connectors, see xref:monitoring::monitor-connectors.adoc[Monitor Connectors]


=== Known Issues

The Anypoint Monitoring log points feature is only supported on Mule runtime engine version 3.8.5-AM or later. For APIs not running on Mule runtime engine 3.8.5-AM or later, the log points feature does not appear for the API.

Since you can't select the runtime version when you deploy an API from API Manager, you need to navigate to Runtime Manager, select the runtime version (3.8.5-AM or later), then redeploy the API.

[NOTE]
Mule runtime engine versions appended with `-AM` are listed in Runtime Manager, in the *Runtime Version* menu under *Show old patch releases*. 

=== Fixed Issues

* General bug fixes.
