== Features and Functionality

=== Anypoint Studio Plugin

There are no new features in this release

=== MUnit Runtime

* Created `MUNIT_RUNNING_COVERAGE` property to distinguish between MUnit runs, and coverage runs. +
This way, the MUnit runtime can differentiate a coverage run, and avoid connectors such as the SAP connector to try to connect to external resources.

* Fixed issue when Studio crashed in Windows whenever the max of GDI objects was reached.
