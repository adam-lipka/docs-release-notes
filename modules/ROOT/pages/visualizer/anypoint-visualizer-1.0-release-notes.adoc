This document describes new features and enhancements, known limitations, issues, and fixes for Anypoint Visualizer. See xref:visualizer::index.adoc[Anypoint Visualizer] documentation for more information.

== April 30, 2019

Visualizer now supports applications deployed to Runtime Fabric. See xref:visualizer::setup.adoc[Set up Anypoint Visualizer] for more information. 

Visualizer relies on a header injection to display connections between services correctly. The header injection is disabled by default for Mule 4. The correct connections will not be displayed for your Mule 4 Runtime Fabric applications unless you enable the header injection. See xref:visualizer::setup.adoc[Set up Anypoint Visualizer] for more information. 

This release has the following known limitations:

* If a Mule 3 CloudHub app with the old Visualizer agent (version earlier than April 5, 2019) calls a Runtime Fabric ingress endpoint, there will be an extra edge from the CloudHub app to a node with the IP address for the controller. Please upgrade to the latest release of the Mule runtime engine.
* If a Mule 4 CloudHub app calls a Runtime Fabric ingress endpoint, there will be and extra edge from the CloudHub app to a node with the IP address for the controller. You can use your filters within Visualizer to hide this node.
* If a Runtime Fabric Mule app calls a Mule 3 CloudHub Mule app with the old Visualizer agent (version earlier than April 5, 2019) using its DNS, the correct connection is drawn, but there will be an additional edge from the *External Traffic* node to the CloudHub app.
* If a Runtime Fabric Mule app calls a Mule 4 CloudHub Mule app using its DNS, the correct connection is drawn, but there will be an additional edge from the *External Traffic* node to the CloudHub app.
* If you have an app in two different clusters with the same name, these applications are drawn as one node on the canvas. You should rename one app. 


== April 25, 2019

* Visualizer editors can define views so that everyone in the organization has a dynamic and consistent view of the architecture for each project. 
* All Visualizer users have a private view, which provides a complete picture of all the apps they have access to.

See xref:visualizer::view.adoc[Visualizer Views] for more information.

== April 5, 2019

* Anypoint Monitoring Agent Moving to Mule Version 3.9 Runtimes

** The latest patch release for Mule runtime engine version 3.9.x (04-05-2019 or later) includes an agent that unifies the Anypoint Monitoring and Anypoint Visualizer agents. Having this single agent means that applications using this Mule version display metrics in Visualizer and the -AM runtime version is no longer required.
** Upgrade to 4.1.x 03-22-2019 or later, or 3.9.x 04-05-2019 or later
+
. If you upgrade Mule 4 to the newest patch (03-22-2019 or later) or the Mule 3.9.x newest patch (04-05-2019 or later), you'll notice that you can't see your apps in Visualizer or Anypoint Monitoring. Don't worry, they are still running.
. You must xref:visualizer::setup.adoc[enable the Anypoint Monitoring agent] to see your applications appear in Visualizer after the upgrade.
+
[NOTE]
Please take careful note of which Mule versions that Visualizer now supports and xref:visualizer::setup.adoc[the necessary tasks to perform] (depending on the version) to ensure that your applications appear in Visualizer and have metrics enabled.

* Visualizer supports dedicated load balancers for apps using Mule version 3.9.x.
+
[NOTE]
While Visualizer doesn't yet support dedicated load balancers for apps using Mule version 4.1.x, MuleSoft anticipates that support for Mule version 4.2.
This anticipation is not a guarantee. Visualizer documentation and release notes will be updated when support is available.

== March 25, 2019

* Standalone Mule Only 
+
Due to a potential performance impact for Mule 4.1.x, header injection in the Anypoint Monitoring agent is now disabled by default for standalone Mule.
Visualizer does not work properly without this header, so to see your applications correctly, you must enable the property at the server level 
after you install the Anypoint Monitoring Agent. 
+
For instructions, see xref:visualizer::setup.adoc#_set_up_for_standalone_mule[Set up Anypoint Visualizer].

== March 23, 2019
Version 2.1.0

== New Features and Enhancements

* Side Panel
** Replaced Rename Node feature with the ability to modify the Display Name of a service from the Customization section of the details.

* View
** Layers set via application properties can no longer be overridden in the Customization section within the Visualizer UI.
** Layers can no longer be deleted or renamed. Instead, reassign a service to a new layer to accomplish the same outcome. 
*** All default layers (System, Process, Experience) will be offered by default and cannot be deleted.

* Anypoint Monitoring Agent Moving to Non-AM Runtimes

** The latest patch release for Mule runtime engine version 4.1.x (03-23-2019 or later) includes an agent that unifies the Anypoint Monitoring and Anypoint Visualizer agents. Having this single agent means that applications using this Mule version display metrics in Visualizer and the -AM runtime version is no longer required.
** Upgrade to 4.1.x 03-23-2019
+
. If you upgrade Mule 4 to the newest patch (03-23-2019 or later), you'll notice that you can't see your apps in Visualizer or Anypoint Monitoring. Don't worry, they are still running.
. You must xref:visualizer::setup.adoc[enable the Anypoint Monitoring agent] to see your applications appear in Visualizer after the upgrade.

[NOTE]
Please take careful note of which Mule versions that Visualizer now supports and xref:visualizer::setup.adoc[the necessary tasks to perform] (depending on the version) to ensure that your applications appear in Visualizer and have metrics enabled.

* View
** Edges shown between services are now active. This means that they appear only if there has been traffic in the past seven days. Non-active edges do not appear on the canvas. 
** When a service connects to a service in an organization in which a user does not have the *CloudHub Viewer* permission, the service the user does not have access to is displayed as an HTTP node. 


== January 8, 2019
Version 2.0.1 

== New Features and Enhancements

* Side Panel
** Changed *Include related services* box to a toggle named *Show dependents and dependencies*, which allows you to view dependencies of the nodes and services with the selected tags.
